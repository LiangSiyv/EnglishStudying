My English Studying stuff
From today, I decided to study English more to meet the requirements of **China Scholarship Council**'s requirement. I want to learn more about what I am studying, which is Deep learning and some other Technology of Computer Science things. To learn more Techs, I need to get in the English World and have to adjust myself to adapt to the English use environment. So I create this GitHub repository, to record what I study and learn.
